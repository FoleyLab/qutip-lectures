    "\n",
    "We want to express uncoupled basis states in terms of the polariton states (eigenstates of the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian). Specifically, we want to know how to build the uncoupled basis state $|0\\rangle \\otimes |g\\rangle$ in terms of the polariton states $|\\psi_0\\rangle, |\\psi_1\\rangle, |\\psi_2\\rangle, |\\psi_3\\rangle$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "The key insight is understanding how the eigenvector matrix provides a change of basis transformation. If eigenvectors are stored in **columns** of a matrix, then the **rows** of that matrix tell us how to express each original basis state in terms of the eigenstates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our Basis Ordering\n",
    "\n",
    "Our uncoupled basis states are ordered as:\n",
    "- Position 0: $|0\\rangle \\otimes |g\\rangle$ \n",
    "- Position 1: $|0\\rangle \\otimes |e\\rangle$\n",
    "- Position 2: $|1\\rangle \\otimes |g\\rangle$\n",
    "- Position 3: $|1\\rangle \\otimes |e\\rangle$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finding the Expansion\n",
    "\n",
    "To express the uncoupled basis state $|0\\rangle \\otimes |g\\rangle$ in terms of polariton states, we look at the **first row** of the eigenvectors matrix (since $|0\\rangle \\otimes |g\\rangle$ is at position 0).\n",

    "From the eigenvectors matrix, the first row is `[1, 0, 0, 0]`, which gives us:\n",

    "Therefore:\n",
    "$$\\boxed{|0\\rangle \\otimes |g\\rangle = |\\psi_0\\rangle}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This result makes physical sense: the ground state of the coupled system is simply the uncoupled state with no photons and the atom in its ground state.\n",
    "\n",
    "## General Rule\n",
    "\n",
    "To express the $i$-th uncoupled basis state in terms of polariton states, use the coefficients from the $i$-th row of the eigenvectors matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$|\\text{uncoupled basis state } i\\rangle = \\sum_j \\text{eigenvectors}[i,j] \\cdot |\\psi_j\\rangle$$\n",

    "### Example: Another Uncoupled State\n",
    "\n",
    "For the uncoupled state $|0\\rangle \\otimes |e\\rangle$ (position 1 in our basis), we use the second row: `eigenvectors[1,:]` = `[0, -0.70710678, 0.70710678, 0]`, giving:\n",
