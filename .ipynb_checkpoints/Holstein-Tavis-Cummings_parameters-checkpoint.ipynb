    "# Modeling Vibronic Polaritons with the Holstein–Tavis–Cummings Model\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "**Vibronic coupling:** In molecules, *vibronic coupling* is the interaction between electronic states and nuclear (vibrational) motion [0, 1]. In other words, an electronic transition often involves changes in molecular geometry, leading to simultaneous electronic *and* vibrational excitation. A classic illustration is the *Franck–Condon* principle: an electronic transition projects the vibrational ground state onto a displaced excited-state potential, creating a ladder of vibrational levels in the excited state.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Holstein Hamiltonian** captures this by coupling a two-level system to a harmonic oscillator:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "H_{\\rm Holstein} = \\hbar\\omega_v b^\\dagger b + \\hbar\\omega_e\\,\\sigma^\\dagger\\sigma - \\hbar\\lambda\\,\\omega_v(b^\\dagger + b)\\,\\sigma^\\dagger\\sigma,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $b^\\dagger b$ is the vibrational (phonon) number, $\\sigma^\\dagger\\sigma$ the electronic excited-state projector, $ \\omega_v $ the vibrational frequency, and $ \\lambda^2 $ is the Huang–Rhys factor [0, 2]. The term \n",
    "$ -\\lambda\\,\\omega_v(b^\\dagger+b)\\,\\sigma^\\dagger\\sigma $ shifts the oscillator equilibrium when the electronic state changes, mixing the vibrational manifold with the electronic levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strong light–matter coupling and polaritons:** When a molecular electronic transition is placed in an optical cavity or near a plasmonic mode, the molecule can coherently exchange energy with a confined photon. If the coupling \\( g \\) is large compared to losses, the system enters the **strong coupling** regime. Here the joint exciton–photon states hybridize into new *polaritonic* eigenstates. In this regime, one observes a Rabi splitting in the spectrum: two new resonances (the *upper* and *lower polaritons*) separated by $\\hbar\\Omega_R \\sim 2g$ at resonance[1, 3, 4].\n",
    "\n",
    "These exciton–polaritons are “half-light, half-matter” quasiparticles. For a single molecule, the Jaynes–Cummings (JC) model describes this, while an ensemble of \\( N \\) identical two-level systems collectively couples to one mode via the **Tavis–Cummings** model[5].\n",
    "\n",
    "Organic molecules have particularly rich vibronic structure. Many organic semiconductors exhibit **strong intramolecular electron–phonon coupling**[6], often comparable to the light–matter coupling in microcavities. This means that vibrations play a central role in polariton physics. Indeed, organic microcavities can confine the field at room temperature and drive the *vacuum Rabi frequency* into the range of molecular vibrational energies[6]. Experiments have revealed puzzling spectra – e.g. very strong emission lines but almost no absorption at certain frequencies near the bare exciton resonance – that cannot be explained by the simple JC or TC models[6].\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Holstein–Tavis–Cummings (HTC) model** extends the Tavis–Cummings model to include molecular vibrations (Holstein coupling) and has been successful in explaining these vibronic polariton effects[1].\n",
    "\n",
    "## Holstein–Tavis–Cummings Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The HTC model describes $ N $ identical organic molecules (each as a two-level chromophore plus a vibrational mode) collectively coupled to a single cavity mode. In second-quantized form the Hamiltonian is the sum of photonic, electronic, and vibrational parts plus their couplings:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "H &= \\hbar\\omega_c\\,a^\\dagger a \n",
    "   + \\sum_{i=1}^N \\Bigl[\n",
    "       \\hbar\\omega_x\\,\\sigma^+_i\\sigma^-_i \n",
    "       + g\\bigl(\\sigma^+_i\\,a + \\sigma^-_i\\,a^\\dagger\\bigr)\n",
    "       + \\hbar\\omega_v\\,b_i^\\dagger b_i \n",
    "       - \\hbar\\lambda\\,\\omega_v\\,(b_i^\\dagger + b_i)\\,\\sigma^+_i\\sigma^-_i\n",
    "   \\Bigr],\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "where $ a $ ($ a^\\dagger $) annihilates a cavity photon of frequency $\\omega_c $, and each molecule $ i $ has an electronic excitation $ \\sigma_i^\\pm $ (raising/lowering operator) of frequency $\\omega_x $, and a vibrational mode $b_i $ ($b_i^\\dagger$ ) of frequency $\\omega_v $.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first sum is the standard Tavis–Cummings part: each excited molecule couples to the cavity photon with strength $ g $. The second sum is $ N $ copies of the Holstein term: when molecule $i $ is excited ($ \\sigma^+_i\\sigma^-_i=1 $), its vibrational mode is displaced by $ \\lambda$ (the Huang–Rhys factor).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Where these come from in your psi4 calculations**\n",
    "- The $\\lambda$ value will be the Huang-Rhys factor you computed for HF (~60)\n",
    "- The $\\omega_x$ value will come from the energy difference between the excited state of HF at the equilibrium geometry and the ground state of HF at the equilibrium geometry\n",
    "- The $\\omega_v$ value will come from the fundamental frequency of HF as calculated on the ground state\n",
    "- The cavity frequency $\\omega_c$ can be set by us, we should go back to the iSWAP gate notebook and take a look at what the cavity frequency was in relation to the excitation energy.  We should try to have a similar relationship between $\\omega_c$ and $\\omega_x$ as in that notebook\n",
    "- The coupling strength $g$ can also be set by us, and again we should look at the iSWAP gate notebook and try to achieve a similar ratio between $g$ and $\\omega_c$ and $\\omega_x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assumptions:** We assume each molecule is a two-level system (valid if only one optical transition dominates) and each has one dominant vibrational mode. Intermolecular exciton hopping or static disorder can be added in more complex models, but the simplest HTC neglects direct molecule–molecule coupling beyond the shared cavity field. Typically one further assumes all molecules have identical $ \\omega_x, \\omega_v, \\lambda, g $ (homogeneous coupling). This leads to a symmetric (Dicke) subspace of collective bright states plus a large manifold of “dark” vibronic states that do not couple directly to the photon[5, 6].\n",
    "\n",
    "**Physical interpretation:** Diagonalizing the HTC Hamiltonian yields polaritonic states dressed by vibrations. For example, the single-excitation manifold contains the lower and upper polariton, each sitting atop a ladder of vibrational sidebands (so-called *polaron polaritons*). The Franck–Condon overlap between vibrational wavefunctions determines the strength of transitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, HTC predicts phenomena like “dark vibronic polaritons”[6] that can emit (via their matter component) even if they absorb weakly, explaining the non-reciprocal spectra seen in organic cavities. In the high-$ N $ limit, collective effects (superradiance) and Hopfield mixing dominate, but the vibronic couplings renormalize Rabi splittings and introduce new relaxation pathways[1].\n",
